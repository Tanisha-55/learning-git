Is there any way or you can suggest me some solution. 
Like in playwright it's a testing framework for web application. And if we have written the testcase like for search functionality it will locate the search box in UI and automatically write something and check the respective expected results. 
Another thing is we have vscode and copilot agent. So what's happening now is like if we need copilot agent to analyse 100sql files. Then we have given 100files but it will take 10files at first and will analyse and while analysing there is a blue button in vscode chat - shows processing. When it stops there will no button, it will like hidden. So this can be the triggering point. After analysing 10files, it will ask to continue, type YES. So, for 100files, we have to write 10 times YES. So, we want to automate this just like playwright. Here, the triggering point will be I already said. So, according to that. It will automatically write YES.
So, is there any way to automate this?
